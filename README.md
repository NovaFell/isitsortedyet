# isitsortedyet

This is a webpage that runs an experiement on single event upsets. In the backend, there is an unsorted array that is constantly being checked to determine if it is sorted. The only thing that could sort this array is if a solar particle happens to flip a bit in the memory location of the array, causing it to flip. The chances of this happening are astronomically low. It is highly likely that the array will remain unsorted for our entire lifetime.
