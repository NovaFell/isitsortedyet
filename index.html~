		<p id="info">Is It Sorted Yet is an experiment on a sorting concept known as Solor BitFlip Sort. In the background of this website, an array is stored that is checked to see if it is sorted 
				every ten seconds. The idea is that a solar particle will hit the memory location, flipping a bit, and cause the array to sort. The chances of this happening are astronomically
				low. You can read more about Solar BitFlips <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-event_upset">here</a></p>
