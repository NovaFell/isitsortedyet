		<p id="info">Is It Sorted Yet is an experiment on a sorting concept known as Solor BitFlip Sort. In the background of this website, an array is stored that is continuously checked to see if it
				is sorted. There is no sorting algorithm applied to the array. The idea is that a solar particle will hit the memory location, flipping a bit, and cause the array to sort.
				The chances of this happening are astronomicallylow. You can read more about Solar BitFlips (also known as Single Event Upsets)
